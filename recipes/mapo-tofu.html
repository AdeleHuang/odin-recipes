    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Soft, silky tofu in a rich, spicy, flavorful meat sauce...it's always a
      crowd pleaser. There are a few ingredients to get to know if you haven't
      had much experience with Chinese cooking, but the process is really
      straight forward and can be a relatively quick dinner. It also keeps well,
      so make lots and have extra for lunch the next day!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ tsp Sichuan peppercorns, toasted</li>
      <li>200g ground beef</li>
      <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2-inch piece ginger, finely chopped</li>
      <li>½ tsp ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp spicy broad bean paste</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp Chinese black beans, rinsed and roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 cup chicken stock or pork stock, UNSALTED, or water</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp Chinese cooking wine (optional)</li>
      <li>1 ½ tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
      <li>350g smooth soft tofu, 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 Green onions, chopped</li>
      <li>Chili oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Toast Sichuan peppercorns in a dry saute pan for a few minutes, stirring
        constantly until they are aromatic and darken slightly. Grind in a
        mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder until fine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a wok or a saute pan over medium high heat, add the ground beef (no
        oil needed) and the soy sauce. Cook the beef, stirring constantly to
        break it up into small pieces, until the water that comes out of the
        meat has evaporated and the beef is browned slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and remove the beef with a slotted spoon, leaving any
        fat behind. If your beef is quite lean and there isn't much fat left,
        add a little more cooking oil to the pan so there's enough to saute the
        garlic and ginger.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat back on to medium, add garlic and ginger and saute until
        the garlic starts to turn golden. Add ground black pepper, half of the
        ground Sichuan peppercorns (or all of it if you like more of the
        numbness and aroma), the broad bean paste and the black beans. Saute the
        herbs and seasoning for about 30 seconds, then deglaze with stock,
        scraping off any bits that are stuck to the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add sugar, Chinese cooking wine, and the beef; simmer gently for 5 mins.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in about 3 Tbsp of cold water.</li>
      <li>
        When the sauce is done simmering, pour in half of the cornstarch slurry
        while stirring, and let it come back to a simmer. Check the sauce for
        thickness, and if it's still too runny, add a little bit more of the
        cornstarch slurry until the desired consistency is reached. Taste and
        adjust seasoning as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tofu to the sauce and gently nudge the tofu around so it is
        sitting in one layer. Spoon some the sauce over the tofu, then let it
        simmer gently for another 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer onto a serving bowl, drizzle with more chili oil if desired,
        and garnish with chopped green onions and some of the reserved Sichuan
        peppercorns if desired. Tip: Some people do not like the numbing
        sensation from the Sichuan peppercorns, so it might be safe to serve the
        extra Sichuan pepper on the side so people can sprinkle on more if they
        want it.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with jasmine rice, and enjoy!</li>
